                <h2 class="article-subheader" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <h3 class="article-body-text">The wall of sound is a production style developed by American producer Phil Spector, which
                    involves layering different instrumental takes to create a blended soundscape. A key component
                    of the technique is to record further away from the instruments to create a reverb effect. This
                    technique has notably been used in albums as diverse as George Harrison’s 1970 ‘All Things
                    Must Pass’, The Beatles' 1970 ‘Let It Be’ and across Tame Impala’s discography. <br><br>

                    He first began experimenting with this style in the early 60s with The Ronettes, and he would go
                    on to produce and record acts such as The Beatles, their solo records and The Ramones.
                    <br>
                    We will explore the technique’s historical influences, alongside some of the modern genres that
                    have put their own innovative spin on this production style. We will be discussing the merits of
                    the technique, such as how well it has aged, how albums using it were originally received, and
                    some of the most common criticisms against it.

                <h2 class="article-subheader" id="origins">Origins</h2>
                <h3 class="article-body-text">
                    Harvey Philip Spector was an American record producer, born in 1939 in New York City.
                    <br><br><br>
                    His first experience with record production was in Gold Star Studios in Hollywood with his band
                    ‘The Teddy Bears’. This is where he would later develop his wall of sound process whilst
                    working as a freelance producer.
                    <br><br><br>
                    The earliest musical development that played a vital role in the wall of sound was instrument
                    layering. Hector Berlioz pioneered this with his exploration into creating new sonic textures
                    through the use of overtones and instruments playing the same parts (Brusen, 1952). This
                    featured heavily in his 1830 composition titled ‘Symphonie Fantastique’ which was considered
                    to be ‘revolutionary, radical and unprecedented’ (Service, 2014). This composition has similar
                    aspects to the wall of sound style, which showcases how these techniques originated in classical
                    settings rather than contemporary pop. Although the wall of sound style is criticized for sounding
                    ‘dated’, this demonstrates that the general principles behind it have longevity.

                    <br><br><br>
                    The wall of sound was primarily inspired by the hit songs of 50’s songwriting duo Jerry Leiber
                    and Mike Stoller (Leiber and Stoller | Encyclopedia.com, no date). Their first hit was ‘Hard
                    Times’ in 1952, followed by ‘Hound Dog’, and ‘Stand By Me’ - alongside a whole host of songs
                    that Elvis covered. Much of their production career (including the examples featured above)
                    features prime examples of instrument layering (Myers, 2012), similar to Spector’s style, but
                    instead focusing on individual instruments for a subtle approach.

                    <br><br><br>
                    In the spring of 1960, Leiber and Stoller’s mentor recognised Spector’s talent in his work with
                    ‘The Teddy Bears’, and invited him to their New York City office to act as a writer and producer
                    (Williams, 2021). During this period, Spector had access to resources which allowed him to
                    experiment with his own production methods. I believe his wall of sound style flourished from
                    the writing duo’s influence and guidance, especially their greater experience in instrument
                    layering (Myers, 2012).
                    <br><br><br>
                    In 1961, after this apprenticeship, “Spector came to form his own independent record company,
                    Philles” (Williams, 2009). He used this as an opportunity to experiment with wall of sound
                    techniques on artists such as The Ronettes and The Crystals.

                    <br><br><br>

                    After the widespread success of these records, Spector had the credibility to select a range of
                    “incredibly technically gifted musicians” that would become his go-to choices; forming a
                    collective that came to be known as ‘The Wrecking Crew’ (Kemp, 2021b) (Fry, 2022).

                    <br><br><br>

                    By assembling The Wrecking Crew, Spector was able to consistently work with a set group of
                    musicians who were familiar with his recording process. I believe this helped him to effectively
                    achieve the production style he envisioned, as the musicians could set up microphones with
                    optimal placements, and were aware of how the positioning of their instruments relative to the
                    microphone would alter the timbre of the recorded sound.

                    <br><br><br>

                    After its assembly, The Wrecking Crew became heavily sought after, especially once they
                    worked for other popular musicians such as Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys and The Monkees
                    (Maranuchi, 2008).

                </h3>


                <h2 class="article-subheader" id="techniques">Techniques in depth</h2>
                <h3 class="article-body-text">

                    The term ‘wall of sound’ was first coined by the manager and publicist for The Rolling Stones,
                    Andrew Loog Oldham (Fry, 2022). This production style is notably characterised by a recording
                    mindset that embraces oversaturation, as the technique often involves layering multiple takes of
                    instruments playing the same part (Kemp, 2021). This allowed Spector to begin “building up a
                    block of sound”. He would proceed to add space between the different elements in the
                    composition with additional plate reverb and mixing (Record Collector, 2020).

                    <br><br><br>

                    Leiber and Stoller created the core idea behind the wall of sound, however, their methods
                    differed from Spector. They intended to retain "much more clarity in terms of instrumental
                    colors”, as opposed to Spector’s approach which “deliberately blended everything into a kind of
                    mulch.” He “was the first one to use multiple drum kits, three pianos and so on.” (Moorefield,
                    2010). These were primary elements in the compositions, which created an active soundscape, as
                    opposed to only applying the method to individual elements like Leiber and Stoller. Their
                    method compared to Phil’s, although not as experimental and all encompassing, proved to be just
                    as effective, as it tended to be more minimal and less divisive as a result.

                    <br><br><br>

                    “Spector chose to exploit the sonic qualities of the studio itself, allowing sounds to bounce
                    around the room and blend into a dense sonic mess, rich with complex overtones” (Kemp, 2021).
                    Spector would also position the microphones strategically; they would often be facing a wall to
                    accentuate the natural reverberative qualities of the space. This would allow him to focus on
                    recording the blended sound of the instruments, rather than trying to isolate each individual
                    instrument (Fields, 2024).


                    <br><br><br>

                    After utilising the recording space, Spector would route the recorded audio into an echo
                    chamber. This drowned out the sound of the dry signal with the signal from the echo chamber,
                    which created a broad spatial quality to the sound (Quinn, 2019). The overall aim was to achieve
                    a fuller and richer tone, so that when mixed well, the individual instruments would become
                    indistinguishable to the listener (Maplethorpe, 2024).

                <h2 class="article-subheader" id="reception">Reception</h2>
                <h3 class="article-body-text">
                    <span class="article-subsubheader">1970: ‘Let It Be’ - The Beatles</span><br>
                    On release, the main criticism from reviewers was that Spector resorted to his usual arsenal of
                    orchestral and choir elements to compliment the songs. This subsequently made the songs feel
                    more insincere and “emotionally vapid”, leaving reviewers feeling that Spector’s production had
                    turned the songs from ‘rough gems’ to ‘costume jewellery’ (Mendelsohn, 1970). However, I
                    believe that the production, most notably the layering, creates a distinct sound for the recordings
                    and makes the tracks feel a lot weightier with the orchestral backing and choir being layered
                    beneath the instruments.

                    <br><br><br>

                    Spector’s production methods were so divisive that the Spector-produced Beatles album ‘Let It
                    Be’ had caused the Beatles to have long divided opinions about the album, until 2003 when they
                    released a ‘de-Spectorised version’ (Starr, 2003) titled ‘Let It Be...Naked’. In this edition, they
                    stripped the production back to the core elements of the album, completely removing any sign of
                    Spector’s influence.

                    <br><br><br>

                    
                    The Beatles previous producer George Martin jokingly suggested that the credits on the album
                    should be “produced by George Martin, over-produced by Phil Spector” (Uncut and Martin,
                    2012). In contrast, John Lennon defended the album’s production, saying: "He was given the
                    shittiest load of badly recorded shit – and with a lousy feeling to it – ever. And he made
                    something out of it” (Lennon, 2020). George Harrison and Ringo Starr kept their positive
                    outlook on the album’s production (Doggett, 2011), with Starr saying "I like what Phil did …
                    there's no point bringing him in if you're not going to like the way he does it" (The Beatles,
                    2000). Paul McCartney believed that Spector didn’t capture their stripped back, live-to-tape
                    aesthetic (DeCurtis, 2018) as evident in the Let It Be documentary with many funny, spirited and
                    communal (Gleiberman, 2024) moments scattered throughout the recording stage.

                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>



                    <span class="article-subsubheader">1977: ‘Death Of A Ladies Man’ - Leonard Cohen</span><br>

                    Another example of Spector’s production negatively impacting an artist’s image can be seen in
                    Leonard Cohen's 1977 album ‘Death of a Ladies Man’. Cohen is widely known for his
                    “minimalist composition of his nylon string guitar, beautiful deep vocals focused on the lyrical
                    content, and the occasional additional instrument joining the mix” (Leatham, 2022). However,
                    when Spector produced this Cohen album, he added an array of complex instrumentation which
                    resulted in the album sounding too bombastic. The production style felt disjointed from Cohen’s
                    vocal performance, and this distracted from the album’s lyrical content.<br><br><br>


                    Later in the recording process, Spector also hijacked creative control of the album, by mixing the
                    songs without Cohen. He used Cohen’s unfinished vocal takes, which were intended solely to
                    guide the backing vocalists, in the final mix. As a result of Spector’s instinctive production
                    method, the album’s vocals forcefully undermine Cohen’s artistic intentions, as he was unable to
                    finalise his vocal performance. Cohen was tempted to overrule the mixing, but Spector had
                    previously threatened him at gunpoint, so he reconsidered and decided that it wasn’t worth
                    challenging (Leatham, 2022).<br><br><br>


                    On the other hand, many, including Cohen, admitted years later that Spector’s decision to retain
                    the original tracking vocals benefitted the overall style of the album. This was due to the general
                    theme of the lyrics being quite ‘sleazy’ (Hewitt, 2019), and this lyrical content was expressed
                    better with a less refined vocal style.<br><br><br>


                    
                    The over-the-top instrumentation used in the wall of sound also helped to portray the overall
                    story of the album. The bombastic style portrayed an illusion of grandeur suitable for a ladies'
                    man, which the album is based around. This interpretation is supported by reviews which
                    describe the production style as ‘costume jewellery’ (Mendelsohn, 1970), which favours
                    appearance over integrity. This expresses an inflated sense of ego and self-image, which fits the
                    concept behind the album’s titular song.

                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

                    <span class="article-subsubheader">1970/2020 Mix: ‘All Things Must Pass’ - George Harrison</span><br>

                    George Harrison’s first solo album ‘All Things Must Pass’ had a very successful release, but the
                    wall of sound production style led to controversy that even George Harrison came to regret
                    (Abbey Road, 2021). This created the dilemma of people loving the album but despising the
                    production; a divide that is still present today.<br><br><br>


                    In 2020, Dhani Harrison and producer Paul Hicks came together to create a new 50th anniversary
                    mix of the album. They tried to appease the fans that wanted it to be kept close to the original,
                    and the others who wanted it ‘de-Spectorised’ (Light, 2021). The resulting mix abolished “all the
                    sludge fomented by Spector’s overuse of reverb and too many overdubs” (Taffel, 2021), pushing
                    Harrison’s vocals to the forefront more than the original mix.<br><br><br>


                    This practise of remixing presents an issue for listeners who consume media through streaming
                    services, as new mixes and remasters of albums tend to be the copies that get circulated by labels
                    on streaming services. Most remasters hosted on these services were done during the ‘loudness
                    wars’ period of reissuing. The loudness wars began to change the sound of music on reissues to
                    make it appear more impactful by increasing the volume of the files, therefore reducing the
                    dynamic range, increasing the perceived loudness to the listener.<br><br><br>


                    The overabundance of reissues has notably led famous artists such as The Beatles and Pink
                    Floyd to be “remastered several times, to the point where it becomes difficult to find a reference
                    version for any of their albums” (Deruty, 2011). Most albums had new mixes created for them to
                    promote new and convenient formats like CD and Minidisc; these mixes were produced
                    primarily out of greed rather than to improve the sound. In addition, the original masters are
                    usually removed from streaming, which forces fans to listen to albums which have been
                    remastered to sound vastly different from the original mix. For artists who have passed away,
                    and who were unable to consent to the differences in the new remasters, the future perception of
                    their album is forcefully altered against their will.

                <h2 class="article-subheader" id="benefits">Benefits of using the wall of sound technique</h2>
                <h3 class="article-body-text">

                    Despite these criticisms, the wall of sound technique also has some striking qualities which I
                    believe could benefit certain songs. Spector’s method of creating reverberation feels like it
                    retains more tonality from the source of sound, as opposed to other methods from the era such as
                    spring or plate reverb.<br><br><br>


                    The Wall Of Sound technique became favourable because of the complex natural reverberation
                    that created Spectors distinctive production sound, when played on AM radio it helps the songs
                    stand out greatly due to this vastly different sound.<br><br><br>


                    Another aspect of Spector’s production that benefits the recordings is that his frequent use of
                    layering instrumentation fleshes out the sound of the mix. Especially when it comes to albums
                    such as George Harrison’s ‘All Things Must Pass’ where Spector compensates for the ‘thinness’
                    of Harrison’s voice by complimenting it with a gentler approach to his wall of sound,
                    highlighting Harrison’s ‘melodic flair’ (Decurtis, 2000) whilst still staying true to Harrison’s
                    original vision.

                <h3 class="article-body-text">
                    Spector’s wall of sound production is generally criticised for his extremely ‘reverb-heavy’
                    production (Browne, 2021) which some people believe make the mixes too distant or muddy.
                    Alongside this, Spector’s productions often feature an extensive array of orchestral
                    instrumentation which can often feel a bit tacky if not executed within a certain context of the
                    recorded performances and artist’s intentions for the composition.

                <h3 class="article-body-text">
                    <span class="article-subsubheader">Shoegaze</span><br>
                    The revival of this production style has its roots within the shoegaze genre, originating in the
                    group Cocteau Twins’ 1982 album ‘Garlands’, as well as Jesus and Mary Chain. Both bands
                    utilise all-encompassing soundscapes, which feature an array of layered instruments and vocals
                    which were commonplace in Spector’s wall of sound productions (Young, 2006).<br><br><br>


                    Shoegaze’s secondary influence, 60s psychedelia, provided the genre’s drone and noise aspects
                    along with the amateur-ish vocal style that originated from the DIY psychedelic movement in the
                    60s (Halligan, 2014).<br><br><br>


                    In 1991 the Irish, English group My Bloody Valentine expanded on this with their album
                    ‘Loveless’, to many this defined the shoegaze genre. The group would layer different guitar
                    takes, which had minor variations on basic chord progressions, and they would then overdub this
                    with some layered vocal melodies (Fisher, 2006).<br><br><br>


                    Both of these artists defined the Shoegaze genre that is still thriving and being discovered by new
                    audiences today.

                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <span class="article-subsubheader">60s Pop Revival</span><br>
                    Spector’s unique style has solidified its status as an iconic staple of 60s music innovation, not
                    only from the vast array of modern artists that have incorporated it into their own styles (such as
                    Tame Impala), but also from those imitating the 60s pop sound entirely, with artists such as Amy
                    Winehouse combining this sound with instrumentation and vocal performances inspired by
                    Motown, Blues and Jazz.<br><br><br>


                    Winehouse and producer Mark Ronson managed to expand on the Phil Spector sound whilst
                    working within the same range of genres to produce something that “plays a trick on the listener,
                    suggesting itself as a song they have known for all of their lives” (Buchanan, 2019).<br><br><br>

                    
                    Winehouse and Ronson’s album ‘Back To Black’ has since become critically acclaimed on a
                    global scale, this shows the timeless quality of the technique, proving that, even when done
                    traditionally, it leaves a lot of options open to mixing a range of different styles together
                    effectively.



                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <span class="article-subsubheader">Alternative/Indie</span><br>

                    This has also become quite commonly used in Indie and Alternative music, with its beginnings in
                    this genre stemming from the aftermath of shoegaze popularizing it has made it even more
                    common.<br><br><br>


                    Notable modern examples (post 2000s) are from groups such as Animal Collective which use the
                    wall of sound production within an entirely new genre, Indie Pop. Their 2009 album
                    ‘Merryweather Post Pavillion’ has been very well received, and the band have been hailed as
                    “one of the 21st century’s most distinctive acts, and one of the most experimental to find
                    widespread success” (Szatan, 2018). This widespread positive feedback goes to show that
                    Spector’s production technique is timeless, with many other new artists becoming very
                    successful whilst using it.<br><br><br>


                    The modern Psychedelic Pop subgenre thrives on the wall of sound production, with artists such
                    as Tame Impala using it as a key element on almost every one of his albums, alongside openly
                    admitting that he has “always been in love with the wall of sound as employed by My Bloody
                    Valentine.” (Los Angeles Times, 2010) with reviews of his latest album mentioning that Phil
                    Spector himself would have been proud of the “enchanting layering of instruments” (Joshi,
                    2020).

                <h2 class="article-subheader" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <h3 class="article-body-text">
                    The wall of sound is a technique that is very divisive with a strong cult following. Its early 60s
                    pop ancestry demonstrated that experimental production practices could prove to be very
                    favourable; it helped substantially to distinguish the song from other pop productions on the
                    radio and set Brian Wilson off on a frenzy to obsessively learn how it was created.<br><br>


                    Analyzing the history of the techniques further we can see that the layering element dates back to
                    mid 19th century Classical compositions by Hector Berlioz.<br><br>


                    Then in later years it went on to inspire the creation of the shoegaze genre, starting with Cocteau
                    Twins in the early 80s until it was fully established in 1991 with My Bloody Valentines’ album
                    ‘Loveless’. The wall of sound influence continued past the prime shoegaze era and continues to
                    be commonly used in a wide range of genres such as Alternative and Indie, being featured by
                    artists such as Tame Impala, Animal Collective and in a range of 60s revivals originating after
                    Amy Winehouse released her seminal album ‘Back To Black’ in 2006.
