FLIGHT GAME



---------GAMEPLAY----------

fun flight physics in semi arcadey style like A Short Hike/Art Of Rally

you have to deliver parcels in your plane to destinations based on a picture of the location and a general direction 

plane customisation and upgrades similar to Dredge

you land your plane (skillfully in different places to chat with locals, maybe be able to exit or just a menu like Dredge)

weather effects and day/night cycle that feels meaningfully long, storms and stuff could mean that you need to fly lower 
and hug mountains to avoid being struck down

collecting sidequests to find all robot parts (across the map) to make a friend




---------WORLD BUILDING----------

do cute little pseudo radio stations with dinky music that pauses in game ambient score

large map with lots of little structures to explore (continuously getting added)

general appearance of A Short Hike but not top-down

nice skybox with stars and bits to provide atmospheric flights
