                    <h3 style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        I opened up Logic with a bass guitar in hand and some ideas in mind. My ideas ranged from
                        70s horror film soundtracks to Western folk songs. I started by playing some midi notes into
                        Logic's virtual bass guitar and recording my finger clicking to create this demo:
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        After booking a studio, I began by routing my bass guitar to the guitar amp and started mic-ing that up, 
                        experimenting with a process called re-amping.
                        <br><br>
                        I started out with some effects, trying to produce something ambient with a guitar. I was heavily inspired by Tangerine
                        Dream’s style of sequencing synths to produce a sort of ethereal atmosphere with an
                        element of percussion and tension. Some of this was accomplished through polyrhythms
                        generated by the delay, and by activating the guitar in different ways, such as: quick brushing,
                        tapping the body, pickups and neck.

                    <h2>Stage Two - Composition</h2>

                    <h3 style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        One song that I liked the composition of recently was ‘(Yo la tengo - False Alarm, 1995); this
                        song begins with a guitar wailing, imitating an alarm, then the drums come in with the bass
                        guitar. I really liked how this was pieced together, as I feel that the quieter intro that was less
                        dense enhanced the impact of the second half of the composition. <br><br>


                        This 'Loud Quiet Loud' technique was popularised by The Pixies. David Bowie said that the
                        key element which made them an influential band was "their pure dynamics, the very
                        obvious now but not obvious at the time dynamic of keeping the verse extremely quiet and then ... 
                        it erupting into a blaze of noise" (Bowie, 2002).  This was key inspiration for my
                        composition as it allowed me to create a greater sense of change between the sections.
                        <br><br>
                        I teamed up with Arthur Robinson, (the drummer of indie-pop band Autocamper) to play
                        drums for my composition, we toyed around with a couple of briefs that we worked on
                        together, some of these started with short sentences such as 'cartoon chase scene' and '60s
                        bossa nova'. We settled on one that I felt contrasted the first section well enough.

                    <h2>Stage Three - Bass & Time</h2>
                    <h3 style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        Me and my friend Hazel worked together to compose a bass guitar part reminiscent of 70s
                        horror soundtracks such as ‘Black Forest’ (Goblin, 1977), although part of my brief was to
                        help bring some structure to the song to help make way for the lyrics so we decided on a 4/4
                        time signature as this helps to provide a set structure for me to write the lyrics, however the
                        negative aspect of this is that it restricts your ability to write the lyrics since you're always
                        trying to consider whether or not they would fit into the composition seamlessly.
                        <br><br>
                        Inspired by songwriters such as John Linnell (They Might Be Giants) who always begin their
                        writing process "starting with the music and the melody" (Linnell, 2003) so that "the lyrics
                        and the music ... have some interesting kind of collision or concordance or contradiction"
                        (Linnell, 2003) which is evident in the song 'Stuff Is Way' because Linnell wrote equally
                        abstract lyrics to fit the song, an opposing example would be how he wrote the song 'I Broke
                        My Own Rule' where the melody is a scale, contrasting this by writing about his own error.

                        <br><br>
                        I felt that this method would allow me to represent the obscured meaning of the song,
                        leaving the lyrics more over to interpretation.

                    <h2>Stage Four - Lyrics</h2>
                    <h3 style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        After recently having rats invade my house, I thought it could be a good topic to base the
                        lyrics around as it has affected my life personally, this is Taylor Swift’s method of songwriting
                        which is “confessional” as she draws from her ”own life and my own stories” (Swift, 2013). I
                        also felt that I would be able to express the experience in a fun manner whilst exaggerating
                        in a couple of places to make the lyrics more engaging.
                        <br><br>
                        When writing the lyrics I started out with a core concept in mind, however I felt the original
                        lyrics had been too heavy-handed about the song's subject. Rats were mentioned too
                        frequently, which became an issue since I didn't want the listener to know the song was
                        about rats until the word was explicitly mentioned. For this, I was inspired by Lloyd Cole's
                        1987 song 'My Bag' which is from the perspective of a cocaine-addicted narrator, but he
                        obscured the lyrics to such an extent where the meaning is still present but it's able to be
                        interpreted in different ways to the extent where "it will mean different things to different
                        people" (Cole, 2008). I was really drawn to this method because I feel that it makes the
                        listener contemplate the meaning of the lyrics in more depth.
                        <br><br>
                        After writing the lyrics I thought a sample would help to give the composition greater depth
                        by using a vocal sample about an invasion of territory during war times, whilst helping to
                        reinforce the previous lyrics. "the samples ... give it ... more structure" (Public Service
                        Broadcasting, 2013) which I feel helps to create a sense of progression through the song and
                        builds tension towards the climax of the second section.
                    </h3>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <h2>Stage Five - Twang Guitar</h2>
                    <h3 style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        For the final segment I came up with the concept of writing three guitar parts that would be
                        layered together.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="assets/content/work/niteblightsbts/tracks.png" width="300px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        <br><br>
                        The <span style="color: white; font-style: italic;">first</span> of the guitar parts is the main layer, which holds the core melody and is constant
                        throughout.
                        <br><br>
                        The <span style="color: white; font-style: italic;">second</span> guitar part is the high frequency layer which accompanies and accentuates
                        certain parts of the main layer.
                        <br><br>
                        The <span style="color: white; font-style: italic;">third</span> guitar part plays the lower frequencies which add the darker undertones to the
                        overall composition.
                        <br><br>
                        I found out that by putting this into practise, I was able to achieve a greater sense of depth.
                        <br>
                        Another vital decision in this recording process for the final section talked about here is the
                        fact that I decided to record this without a click track, as this segment was intended to
                        represent decay and societal collapse I felt that it would provide a subtle sense of disorder
                        whilst developing the 'rambling' style.

                        <h3 style="color: white;">If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading, I really enjoyed putting this project together
